# Overview

We offer several ways to install InvokeAI, each one suited to your
experience and preferences. We suggest that everyone start by
reviewing the
[hardware](010_INSTALL_AUTOMATED.md#hardware_requirements) and
[software](010_INSTALL_AUTOMATED.md#software_requirements)
requirements, as they are the same across each install method. Then
pick the install method most suitable to your level of experience and
needs.

See the [troubleshooting
section](010_INSTALL_AUTOMATED.md#troubleshooting) of the automated
install guide for frequently-encountered installation issues.

This fork is supported across Linux, Windows and Macintosh. Linux users can use
either an Nvidia-based card (with CUDA support) or an AMD card (using the ROCm
driver).


## **[Automated Installer (Recommended)](010_INSTALL_AUTOMATED.md)**
 ‚úÖ This is the recommended installation method for first-time users. 

  This is a script that will install all of InvokeAI's essential
  third party libraries and InvokeAI itself.

üñ•Ô∏è **Download the latest installer .zip file here** : https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI/releases/latest
  
- *Look for the file labelled "InvokeAI-installer-v3.X.X.zip" at the bottom of the page*
- If you experience issues, read through the full [installation instructions](010_INSTALL_AUTOMATED.md) to make sure you have met all of the installation requirements. If you need more help, join the [Discord](discord.gg/invoke-ai) or create an issue on [Github](https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI).



## **[Manual Installation](020_INSTALL_MANUAL.md)**
This method is recommended for experienced users and developers.

  In this method you will manually run the commands needed to install
  InvokeAI and its dependencies. We offer two recipes: one suited to
  those who prefer the `conda` tool, and one suited to those who prefer
  `pip` and Python virtual environments. In our hands the pip install
  is faster and more reliable, but your mileage may vary.
  Note that the conda installation method is currently deprecated and
  will not be supported at some point in the future.

## **[Docker Installation](040_INSTALL_DOCKER.md)**
This method is recommended for those familiar with running Docker containers.

We offer a method for creating Docker containers containing InvokeAI and its dependencies. This method is recommended for individuals with experience with Docker containers and understand the pluses and minuses of a container-based install.
